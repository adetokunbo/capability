-- Example Programs

-- | Increase a counter using a writer monad.
useWriter :: HasWriter "count" (Sum Int) m => m ()

-- | Mix writer and state monad operations on the same tag.
--
-- Note, mixing capabilities on the same tag like this is inadvisable in
-- real applications.  The @HasState@ capability could be used to clear the
-- accumulated outcome of the @HasWriter@ capability.
